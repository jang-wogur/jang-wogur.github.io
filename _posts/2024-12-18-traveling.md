# Encountering Uncertainties
To take a short trip to Tokyo, I woke up at 4 a.m. on a Friday in November, 2024. The flight was around 8 in the morning and I took an airport bus which was full in the middle of the ride. The ride was not pleasant due to a foreign passenger right behind my seat barking at his phone during the whole trip with his speaker on. However, my excitement for the trip had hit the lowest bottom when I realized I had forgotten my passport by the time I arrived at the Incheon International Airport. It was my first time ever not to be prepared for a flight in my experiences of numerous trips abroad.

I knew that I could temporarily print out my passport from an emergency office in the airport but they were not to be opened after 9, which was too late for my reserved flight. The look on the flight attendant's face at the check-in desk seemed concerned after hearing my story as I asked for help but the best service she could provide was showing her.

With an hour left before the flight, I rechecked the app to check if any other plane tickets were available. There was one in the afternoon with the similar price I had bought but my plane ticket was un-refundable, meaning that I had to pay another round trip of plane ticket right at the spot. So I had to reprocess my mind to ask myself whether the trip was worth it.

The original reason I had scheduled this trip was to celebrate my third year anniversary with my girlfriend who was living in Tokyo at the moment. She was not much of an event-girl type but it was still clearly a valid point for me to make this trip. Overcoming the embarrassment, I called my father for help who came right away with my passport in his hand for my freshly bought flight. At that moment, I recognized I was transferring the love I had received from my parents to my girlfriend. That night, I arrived at Tokyo before the dinner and I had a successful date. This story would live inside me forever and would probably be reminisced in my old days, and I will be longing the young boy passionate for love.

As so, trips either short or long, always come with uncertainties. Unexpected events are not always welcomed by everyone but this is the main thing I love about traveling. This is the core reason I like to simply walk along random streets and visit random shops without searching the Google maps while abroad. The randomness sometimes leads me to delightful cuisines and wonderful people which keeps me feel alive from the repetitive exhausting daily life back in Seoul.

How can we define the practice of "traveling"?
